# FMCG-Project
 The project aims to conduct sales and profit analysis by creating insightful dashboards from an FMCG retail dataset containing 47,040 rows and 14 columns.
The dataset includes FMCG data for the years 2019 to 2021 across five regions, with 47,040 rows and 14 columns. The columns are: Order ID, Product Purchased, Product Code, Quantity, Sales, Region, Date, Store Type, Category, Margin, Year, Month, Quarter, and Profit. The columns Category, Margin, Year, Month, Quarter, and Profit were newly derived. After arranging the data, pivot tables were created, and sales and profit dashboards were added. These dashboards display information by store, category, region, monthly trends, and the top 5 and bottom 5 products. Year and Region were used as filters (Slicers). The dashboards show that sales and profits increased in September and October, with perfume being the best-selling and most profitable product, while chips are the least sold and least profitable. Finally, a new worksheet called "HOME PAGE" was added to the Excel file, featuring buttons that link to the respective worksheets using the hyperlink function.
